#### [PATCH 01/28] arm64: KVM: Skip MMIO insn after emulation
##### From: Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>

```c
From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

When we emulate an MMIO instruction, we advance the CPU state within
decode_hsr(), before emulating the instruction effects.

Having this logic in decode_hsr() is opaque, and advancing the state
before emulation is problematic. It gets in the way of applying
consistent single-step logic, and it prevents us from being able to fail
an MMIO instruction with a synchronous exception.

Clean this up by only advancing the CPU state *after* the effects of the
instruction are emulated.

From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

When we emulate a guest instruction, we don't advance the hardware
singlestep state machine, and thus the guest will receive a software
step exception after a next instruction which is not emulated by the
host.

We bodge around this in an ad-hoc fashion. Sometimes we explicitly check
whether userspace requested a single step, and fake a debug exception
from within the kernel. Other times, we advance the HW singlestep state
rely on the HW to generate the exception for us. Thus, the observed step
behaviour differs for host and guest.

Let's make this simpler and consistent by always advancing the HW
singlestep state machine when we skip an instruction. Thus we can rely
on the hardware to generate the singlestep exception for us, and never
need to explicitly check for an active-pending step, nor do we need to
fake a debug exception from the guest.

#### [PATCH] KVM: x86: nSVM: fix switch to guest mmu
##### From: Vitaly Kuznetsov <vkuznets@redhat.com>

```c
Recent optimizations in MMU code broke nested SVM with NPT in L1
completely: when we do nested_svm_{,un}init_mmu_context() we want
to switch from TDP MMU to shadow MMU, both init_kvm_tdp_mmu() and
kvm_init_shadow_mmu() check if re-configuration is needed by looking
at cache source data. The data, however, doesn't change - it's only
the type of the MMU which changes. We end up not re-initializing
guest MMU as shadow and everything goes off the rails.

The issue could have been fixed by putting MMU type into extended MMU
role but this is not really needed. We can just split root and guest MMUs
the exact same way we did for nVMX, their types never change in the
lifetime of a vCPU.

There is still room for improvement: currently, we reset all MMU roots
when switching from L1 to L2 and back and this is not needed.

##### From: Vitaly Kuznetsov <vkuznets@redhat.com>

```c
AMD doesn't seem to implement MSR_IA32_MCG_EXT_CTL and svm code in kvm
knows nothing about it, however, this MSR is among emulated_msrs and
thus returned with KVM_GET_MSR_INDEX_LIST. The consequent KVM_GET_MSRS,
of course, fails.

Report the MSR as unsupported to not confuse userspace.
