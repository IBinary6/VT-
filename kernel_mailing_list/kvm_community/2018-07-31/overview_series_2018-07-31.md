#### [GIT PULL] Please pull my kvm-ppc-next-4.19-1 tag
##### From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@ozlabs.org>

```c
Paolo or Radim,

Please do a pull from my kvm-ppc-next-4.19-1 tag to get a PPC update
for 4.19.  There is not much in there, just some code cleanups and bug
fixes.

Michael Ellerman also has some changes that touch arch/powerpc/kvm in
his topic/ppc-kvm branch, which he has merged into his next branch.  I
have not pulled them into my tree since there are no conflicts with
the changes in my kvm-ppc-next branch.

Thanks,
Paul.

#### [PATCH 01/16] KVM: nVMX: move host EFER consistency checks to VMFail path
##### From: Sean Christopherson <sean.j.christopherson@intel.com>

```c
Invalid host state related to loading EFER on VMExit causes a
VMFail(VMXERR_ENTRY_INVALID_HOST_STATE_FIELD), not a VMExit.

#### [PATCH] KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Exiting split hack mode needs to fixup both PC and LR
##### From: Cameron Kaiser <spectre@floodgap.com>

```c
When an OS (currently only classic Mac OS) is running in KVM-PR and makes a
linked jump from code with split hack addressing enabled into code that does
not, LR is not correctly updated and reflects the previously munged PC. This
undoes the address munge when exiting split hack mode so that code relying
on LR being a proper address will now execute. This does not affect OS X
or other operating systems running on KVM-PR.

#### [PATCH] KVM: vmx: write HOST_IA32_EFER in vmx_set_constant_host_state()
##### From: Sean Christopherson <sean.j.christopherson@intel.com>

```c
EFER is constant in the host and writing it once during setup means
we can skip writing the host value in add_atomic_switch_msr_special().

#### [PATCH] KVM: X86: Disable KVM_FEATURE_STEAL_TIME when both delayacct_on added to cmdline and CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS is set
##### From: Chen Xiao <abigwc@gmail.com>

```c
From: Chen Xiao <abigwc@163.com>

When sched_info_on returns 1ï¼ŒKVM_FEATURE_STEAL_TIME will be set,
steal% can be seen in the virtual machine.The returned value of
sched_info_on depends on delayacct_on. If nodelayacct is added to
kernel boot cmdline,the KVM_FEATURE_STEAL_TIME will be turned off
by setting delayacct_on to 0.When CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS is set, sched_info_on
always returns 1, and adding nodelayacct to the cmdline cannot turn
off the KVM_FEATURE_STEAL_TIME Sometimes the users do not want the
running state of host to be perceived in the virtual machine, and 
intend to turn off KVM_FEATURE_STEAL_TIME. The requirement is not
available, however, when CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS has been set.Modify the
judgment criteria for being set up from KVM_FEATURE_STEAL_TIME, and
it is only be judged by the value of delayacct_on.
