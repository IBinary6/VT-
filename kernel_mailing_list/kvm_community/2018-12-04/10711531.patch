Subject: [PATCH kvmtool 0/6] arm: Add support for firmware booting

Hi,

This series is based on the virtio reset series posted earlier:
https://marc.info/?l=kvm&m=154392174625966&w=2

We would like to be able to load firmwares like UEFI in kvmtool.

The series contains:
A way to load the firmware into RAM and an option to be able to create
non-volatile memory zones and load data into them.

Those non-volatile memory are presented throught the DT with a node:

	<name>@<addr> {
		compatible = "kvmtool,<name>";
		reg = < <addr> <size> >;
	}

These are expected to be dealt with by specific kvmtool driver and not
to be picked up by existing drivers (although technically it is just
plain memory, mapped in the guest).

Cheers,

Julien
