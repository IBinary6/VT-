Subject: [PATCH kvmtool v2 0/6] arm: Add support for firmware booting

Hi,

This series is based on the virtio reset series[1] posted earlier.

We would like to be able to load firmwares like UEFI in kvmtool.

The series contains:
A way to load the firmware into RAM and an option to be able to create
non-volatile memory zones and load data into them.

Those non-volatile memory are presented throught the DT with a node:

	<flash>@<addr> {
		compatible = "kvmtool,flash";
		reg = < <addr> <size> >;
		label = <name>;
	}

These are expected to be dealt with by specific kvmtool driver and not
to be picked up by existing drivers (although technically it is just
plain memory, mapped in the guest).


Changes since v1[2]:
* Added Andre's Reviewed-by tags.
* Changed the DT binding for nvmem.
* removed the requirement to provide firmware load address (defaults to
  the start of RAM).
