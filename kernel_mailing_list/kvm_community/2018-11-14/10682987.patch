Hi all,

here's a rediff ontop of -rc2. No changes, only added Yazen's Tested-by.

Please queue,
thx.

Changelog:
==========

v2:

here's v2, dropping patch 3 and incorporating hopefully all of Radim's
feedback.

v1:

there's this mce-inject.ko module in the kernel which allows for
injecting real MCEs and thus test the MCE handling code.

It is doubly useful to be able to inject same MCEs in a guest so that
testing of the MCE handling code can happen even easier/faster. In order
to be able to do that on an AMD guest, we need to emulate some bits
and pieces like the HWCR[McStatusWrEn] bit which allows writes to the
MCi_STATUS registers without a #GP.

The below does that and with it I'm able to properly inject MCEs in said
guest.
