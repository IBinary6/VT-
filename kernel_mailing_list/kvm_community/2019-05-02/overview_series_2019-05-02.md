#### [PATCH 1/3] kvm: nVMX: Set nested_run_pending in vmx_set_nested_state after checks complete
##### From: Aaron Lewis <aaronlewis@google.com>

```c
nested_run_pending=1 implies we have successfully entered guest mode.
Move setting from external state in vmx_set_nested_state() until after
all other checks are complete.

#### [GIT PULL] Please pull my kvm-ppc-next-5.2-1 tag
##### From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@ozlabs.org>

```c
Paolo or Radim,

Please do a pull from my kvm-ppc-next-5.2-1 tag to get a PPC update
for 5.2.  The main new feature here is that we can now let guests
access the POWER9 XIVE interrupt controller directly for things like
acknowledge, EOI, enable and disable on interrupts, rather than
requiring guests to do hypercalls for these operations.

I have merged in the topic/ppc-kvm branch from the powerpc tree
because one of the patches there is a prerequisite for the XIVE patch
series.  That's why there are changes to arch/powerpc/kernel in the
diffstat.

Stephen Rothwell noted a conflict between my tree and the kvm-arm tree
because we have both allocated new capability numbers.

The XIVE patch series also modifies generic KVM code to add mmap and
release methods on KVM devices.

Thanks,
Paul.

#### [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Set msr bitmap correctly for MSR_FS_BASE in vmcs02
##### From: Jintack Lim <jintack@cs.columbia.edu>

```c
Even when neither L0 nor L1 configured to trap MSR_FS_BASE writes from
its own VMs, the current KVM L0 always traps MSR_FS_BASE writes from L2.
Let's check if both L0 and L1 disabled trap for MSR_FS_BASE for its VMs
respectively, and let L2 write to MSR_FS_BASE without trap if that's the
case.

#### [kvm-unit-tests PATCH] lib/alloc_page: Zero allocated pages
##### From: nadav.amit@gmail.com

```c
From: Nadav Amit <nadav.amit@gmail.com>

One of the most important properties of tests is reproducibility. For
tests to be reproducible, the same environment should be set on each
test invocation.

When it comes to memory content, this is not exactly the case in
kvm-unit-tests. The tests might, mistakenly or intentionally, assume
that memory is zeroed, which apparently is the case after seabios runs.
However, failures might not be reproducible if this assumption is
broken.

As an example, consider x86 do_iret(), which mistakenly does not push
SS:RSP onto the stack on 64-bit mode, although they are popped
unconditionally.

Do not assume that memory is zeroed. Clear it once it is allocated to
allow tests to easily be reproducible.

#### [kvm-unit-tests PATCH] x86: Set "APIC Software Enable" after APIC reset
##### From: nadav.amit@gmail.com

```c
From: Nadav Amit <nadav.amit@gmail.com>

After the APIC is reset, some of its registers might be reset. As the
SDM says: "When IA32_APIC_BASE[11] is set to 0, prior initialization to
the APIC may be lost and the APIC may return to the state described in
Section 10.4.7.1". The SDM also says that after APIC reset "the
spurious-interrupt vector register is initialized to 000000FFH". This
means that after the APIC is reset it needs to be software-enabled
through the SPIV.

This is done one occasion, but there are (at least) two occasions that
do not software-enable the APIC after reset (__test_apic_id() and main()
in vmx.c).

Move APIC SPIV reinitialization into reset_apic(). Remove SPIV settings
which are unnecessary after reset_apic() is modified.

#### [PATCH v8 1/4] s390: ap: kvm: add PQAP interception for AQIC
##### From: Pierre Morel <pmorel@linux.ibm.com>

```c
We prepare the interception of the PQAP/AQIC instruction for
the case the AQIC facility is enabled in the guest.

First of all we do not want to change existing behavior when
intercepting AP instructions without the SIE allowing the guest
to use AP instructions.

In this patch we only handle the AQIC interception allowed by
facility 65 which will be enabled when the complete interception
infrastructure will be present.

We add a callback inside the KVM arch structure for s390 for
a VFIO driver to handle a specific response to the PQAP
instruction with the AQIC command and only this command.

But we want to be able to return a correct answer to the guest
even there is no VFIO AP driver in the kernel.
Therefor, we inject the correct exceptions from inside KVM for the
case the callback is not initialized, which happens when the vfio_ap
driver is not loaded.

We do consider the responsability of the driver to always initialize
the PQAP callback if it defines queues by initializing the CRYCB for
a guest.
If the callback has been setup we call it.
If not we setup an answer considering that no queue is available
for the guest when no callback has been setup.
