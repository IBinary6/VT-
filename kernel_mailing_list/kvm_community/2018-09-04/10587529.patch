I dropped the version numbers, but this is v4 of Shih-Wei Li's series of
the same name, last posted in January. I took the liberty of
incorporating all the comments v3 had, plus making some other cleanup
tweaks. These tests are too nice to let them slip away, let's get them
reviewed and merged.

v3:
 - add missing breaks in switch statement [Shih-Wei]
v2:
 - add missing 'L' in 'UL' for PS_PER_SEC. There's a lot of picoseconds
   in a second!

Thanks,
drew
