Subject: [PATCH 0/5] KVM: VMX: INTR, NMI and #MC cleanup
Date: Fri, 19 Apr 2019 22:50:54 -0700

This series' primarily focus is to refine VMX's handling of INTRs, NMIs
and #MCs after a VM-Exit, making a few small optimizations and hopefully
resulting in more readable code.

There's also a bug fix related to handling #MCs that occur during VM-Entry
that was found by inspection when doing the aforementioned cleanup.

Sean Christopherson (5):
  KVM: VMX: Fix handling of #MC that occurs during VM-Entry
  KVM: VMX: Read cached VM-Exit reason to detect external interrupt
  KVM: VMX: Store the host kernel's IDT base in a global variable
  KVM: x86: Move kvm_{before,after}_interrupt() calls to vendor code
  KVM: VMX: Handle NMIs, #MCs and async #PFs in common irqs-disabled fn
