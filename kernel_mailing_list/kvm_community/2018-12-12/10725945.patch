Hi:

This series tries to fix various issues of vhost:

- Patch 1 adds a missing write barrier between used idx updating and
  logging.
- Patch 2-3 brings back the protection of device IOTLB through vq
  mutex, this fixes possible use after free in device IOTLB entries.
- Patch 4-7 fixes the diry page logging when device IOTLB is
  enabled. We should done through GPA instead of GIOVA, this was done
  through intorudce HVA->GPA reverse mapping and convert HVA to GPA
  during logging dirty pages.

Please consider them for -stable.

Thanks

Changes from V1:
- silent compiler warning for 32bit.
- use mutex_trylock() on slowpath instead of mutex_lock() even on fast
  path.

Jason Wang (4):
  vhost: make sure used idx is seen before log in vhost_add_used_n()
  vhost_net: switch to use mutex_trylock() in vhost_net_busy_poll()
  Revert "net: vhost: lock the vqs one by one"
  vhost: log dirty page correctly
