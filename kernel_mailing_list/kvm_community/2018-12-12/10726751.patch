Changes in v2:
- PATCH2 added [Roman Kagan]

This is a follow-up to my "x86/kvm/hyper-v: direct mode for synthetic
timers" series. Roman identified a couple of issues with the patchset:
we don't check that the supplied APIC vector is valid and we care about
EOI for nothing. These can be merged with the original patch implementing
direct mode stimers or just put on top.

Vitaly Kuznetsov (2):
  x86/hyper-v: Stop caring about EOI for direct stimers
  x86/kvm/hyper-v: disallow setting illegal vectors for direct mode
    stimers
