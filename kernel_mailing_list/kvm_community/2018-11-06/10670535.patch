High GPAs may not get used much with "normal" guest configs. Let's make
sure we use them with the selftests. I've tested this on an AArch64
machine that supports up to 48-bit IPAs using a host kernel with the
recent > 40-bit IPA patches. We may want to modify the framework for
x86_64 someday to enable tests for 5-level page tables (or even just
to fully support the use of 4-level page tables.) For now, I just
made sure the x86_64 dirty log test still runs.

Andrew Jones (7):
  kvm: selftests: x86_64: dirty_log_test: fix -t
  kvm: selftests: dirty_log_test: don't identity map the test mem
  kvm: selftests: dirty_log_test: always use -t
  kvm: selftests: dirty_log_test: reset guest test phys offset
  kvm: selftests: dirty_log_test: improve mode param management
  kvm: selftests: add pa-48/va-48 VM modes
  kvm: selftests: aarch64: dirty_log_test: support greater than 40-bit
    IPAs
