Subject: [kvm-unit-tests PATCH 0/5] x86: nVMX: Address feedback on EPT series

A recent series to fix a variety of EPT related bugs[1] introduced a
few new issues of its own.  The issues were caught in code review, but
not until the series was applied (Paolo was especially quick on the
trigger that day).

[1] https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/10808887/

Sean Christopherson (5):
  x86: nVMX: Check the return value of setup_eptp() in setup_ept()
  x86: nVMX: Pre-check EPT requirement for unrestricted guest
  x86: nVMX: Require WB for the EPT walks when possible
  x86: nVMX: Rename EPT setup functions to better convey their scope
  x86: nVMX: Add comments to the EPT helper functions
