VMCLEAR implementation for Enlightened VMCS is not entirely correct
when something else than the currently active eVMCS on the calling vCPU
is targeted. In case there's no currently active eVMCS on the calling vCPU
we are corrupting the targeted area by writing to the non-existent
launch_state field.

Fix the logic by always treating the targeted area as 'enlightened' in case
Enlightened VMEntry is enabled on the calling vCPU.

Changes since v1:
- 'evmcs_vmptr' -> 'evmcs_gpa' [Paolo Bonzini]
- avoid nested_release_evmcs() in handle_vmclear even for the currently
  active eVMCS on the calling vCPU [Liran Alon], PATCH1 added to support
  the change.
