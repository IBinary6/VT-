When live-migration with large-memory guests, vcpu may hang for a long
time while starting migration, such as 9s for 2T
(linux-5.0.0-rc2+qemu-3.1.0).
The reason is memory_global_dirty_log_start() taking too long, and the
vcpu is waiting for BQL. The page-by-page D bit clearup is the main time
consumption. I think that the idea of "KVM: MMU: fast write protect" by
xiaoguangrong, especially the function kvm_mmu_write_protect_all_pages(),
is very helpful. After a little modifcation, on his patch, can solve
this problem, 9s to 0.5s.

At the beginning of live migration, write protection is only applied to the
top-level SPTE. Then the write from vm trigger the EPT violation, with
for_each_shadow_entry write protection is performed at dirct_map.
Finally the Dirty bit of the target page(at level 1 page table) is cleared,
and the dirty page tracking is started. The page where GPA is located is
marked dirty when mmu_set_spte.
A similar implementation on xen, just emt instead of write protection.

v1 -> v2:

  - drop "KVM: MMU: correct the behavior of mmu_spte_update_no_track"
  - mmu_write_protect_all_indicator is no longer an atomic variable,
    protected by mmu_lock
  - Implement kvm_mmu_slot_set_dirty with kvm_mmu_write_protect_all_pages
  - some modification on the commit messages

1.8.3.1
