Subject: [PATCH 00/14] KVM: arm/arm64: Various rework in preparation of nested
 virt support
Date: Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:00:18 +0100

This series contains a somewhat random set of reworks and improvements to the
KVM/Arm code in preparation for nested virtualization support.

We plan to merge these as early as v5.1.

The series relies on an additional patch which exposes the physical EL1 timer's
IRQ number to KVM:
  "clocksource/arm_arch_timer: Store physical timer IRQ number for KVM on VHE"
