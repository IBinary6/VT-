Hi:

This series implement basic in order feature support for
vhost_net. This feature requires both driver and device to use
descriptors in order which can simplify the implementation and
optimizaton for both side. The series also implement a simple
optimization that avoid read available ring. Test shows 10%
performance improvement.

More optimizations could be done on top.

Jason Wang (3):
  virtio: introduce in order feature bit
  vhost_net: support in order feature
  vhost: don't touch avail ring if in_order is negotiated
