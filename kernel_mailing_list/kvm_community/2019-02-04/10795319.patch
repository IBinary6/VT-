Hi,

This patch series fixes a few warnings when building kvmtool with GCC8.
I'm not sure it's the best solution for each case.

Note that kvmtool was removed from Debian testing following these
warnings (but it's using an old version):
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=897777

I do not know why it wasn't built with WERROR=0 instead.

Changes since v1:
 - series rebased on master
 - patch 1: fixed snprintf size thanks to Will's review
 - patch 2: added another similar warning fix in the same file
 - patch 3: errno isn't touched anymore (thanks Will)

@Andre: I did not pick up your Reviewed-by for patch 2 since it was
modified afterwards.

Regards,

Anisse
