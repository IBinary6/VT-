Paolo or Radim,

Please do a pull from my kvm-ppc-next-4.20-1 tag to get a PPC KVM
update for 4.20.  There is one big new feature here, which is nested
virtualization support for radix guests on POWER9, plus a few other
fixes and improvements.

A lot of the commits here are also going to be merged in the powerpc
tree via the topic/ppc-kvm branch, in order to reduce conflicts
between the powerpc tree and the kvm tree.

Stephen Rothwell noted that there is a conflict between my
kvm-ppc-next tree and the kvm-arm tree, in that we have both allocated
the next free capability number (160).  It would be nice to get a
stable allocation for the new capability that I need (one which
reports/enables nested virtualization support for the HV KVM module)
so that the necessary QEMU patches can be submitted.

Thanks,
Paul.

  KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add NO_HASH flag to GET_SMMU_INFO ioctl result (2018-10-09 16:14:54 +1100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
PPC KVM update for 4.20.

The major new feature here is nested HV KVM support.  This allows the
HV KVM module to load inside a radix guest on POWER9 and run radix
guests underneath it.  These nested guests can run in supervisor mode
and don't require any additional instructions to be emulated, unlike
with PR KVM, and so performance is much better than with PR KVM, and
is very close to the performance of a non-nested guest.  A nested
hypervisor (a guest with nested guests) can be migrated to another
host and will bring all its nested guests along with it.  A nested
guest can also itself run guests, and so on down to any desired depth
of nesting.

Apart from that there are a series of updates for IOMMU handling from
Alexey Kardashevskiy, a "one VM per core" mode for HV KVM for
security-paranoid applications, and a small fix for PR KVM.
