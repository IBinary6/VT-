Paolo or Radim,

Please do a pull from my kvm-ppc-next-4.20-2 tag to get a second
update for PPC KVM to go into 4.20.  This is a very small update, with
only two commits.  It turned out to be necessary to disable the new
nested HV KVM feature on early POWER9 chips that need a particular
hardware bug workaround which the new guest entry path doesn't
implement, so one commit does that.  The other commit is an
optimization for clearing IOMMU tables when doing PCI pass-through.

The second commit touches drivers/vfio/vfio_iommu_spapr_tce.c as well
as arch/powerpc/kvm code.  That should be OK, as Alexey Kardashevskiy
is pretty much the only person that touches that file.  However, if
you would prefer that part of the change to go via another tree, let
me know and I'll re-do the pull request without that commit (or you
can just merge the other commit on its own).

Thanks,
Paul.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Second PPC KVM update for 4.20.

Two commits; one is an optimization for PCI pass-through, and the
other disables nested HV-KVM on early POWER9 chips that need a
particular hardware bug workaround.
