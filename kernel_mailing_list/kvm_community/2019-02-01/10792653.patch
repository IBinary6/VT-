Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] Various convenience fixes
Date: Fri,  1 Feb 2019 12:37:12 +0000

As I found myself using kvmtool more often in the last weeks, I got more
and more annoyed by some smaller "ticks" that kvmtool shows.

So this is an attempt to post various smaller fixes I gathered up over
the years, but never found worth enough to send out.
Version 2 drops the two patches that have been merged already, and
amends the remaining ones.

The patches address:
- add /chosen/stdout-path node in .dtb
- honour make -s switch
- remove pointless kvmtool version number
- introduce autodetection of supported GIC type

Changelog v1..v2:
- stdout-path: Let hw/serial.c set the node path and use an alias
- make -s: adapt to newest version from the Linux kernel
- kvmtool "version" number: unchanged, but verified to be compatible
  with the Debian package
- GIC autodetection: ignore --force-pci, always try to have an MSI
  controller

Please have a look!

Cheers,
Andre.
