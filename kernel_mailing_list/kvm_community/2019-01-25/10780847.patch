Subject: [PATCH 0/5] KVM: arm/arm64: Fix VCPU power management problems
Date: Fri, 25 Jan 2019 10:46:51 +0100

This series fixes a number of issues:

 - When powering on and resetting VCPUs, we can be preempted in the
   middle which can lead to guest system register corruption.

 - We were missing support for PSCI ON_PENDING when multiple VCPUs try
   to turn on a target VCPU at the same time.

 - Powering off a VCPU could race with powering on the same VCPU.

 - We unnecesarily panic'ed if we found a non-initialized guest system
   register.

The main approach to fixing all these problems is by using VCPU
requests.

See the individual patches for more details.

Christoffer Dall (3):
  KVM: arm/arm64: Reset the VCPU without preemption and vcpu state
    loaded
  KVM: arm/arm64: Require VCPU threads to turn them self off
  KVM: arm/arm64: Implement PSCI ON_PENDING when turning on VCPUs

Marc Zyngier (2):
  arm/arm64: KVM: Allow a VCPU to fully reset itself
  arm/arm64: KVM: Don't panic on failure to properly reset system
    registers
