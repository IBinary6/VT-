Subject: [kvm-unit-tests PATCH 0/3] KVM: nVMX: Fix unrestricted guest toggling

The event injection test toggles unrestricted guest to target the
consistency checks related to exception error codes.  In doing so, it
fails to properly meet unrestricted guest's requirement of EPT being
enabled.  Patch 3/3 fixes the actual bug, patches 1/3 and 2/3 tweak the
EPT configuration flow to better support tests that want to enable EPT
but never expect to fulloy enter the guest, i.e. don't need to setup the
actual page tables.

Sean Christopherson (3):
  KVM: nVMX: Remove redundant masking with allowed exec controls mask
  KVM: nVMX: Add enable_ept() helper to configure legal EPTP
  KVM: nVMX: Properly configured unrestricted guest for event injection
