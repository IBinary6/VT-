The VMX validation space is ginormous, e.g. there are hundreds if not
thousands of combinations of control settings alone to test, and that's
not counting tests like the VMCS shadowing test that permute every
possible value of the test space and generate tens of thousands of
sub-tests.

Because of the sheer number of things to validate, the VMX code crams
many individual test, i.e. things that report PASS/FAIL, into each
test function, i.e. a collection of tests that can be explicitly
invoked via command line, and then consolidates several test functions
under an actual test case, i.e. an entry in x86/unittests.cfg.

While the VMX test infrastructure isn't terrible (I wouldn't call it
"good" either), the testcases defind in unittests.cfg are a mess.
Clean up the worst of the mess so that the defined testcases are at
least somewhat sane, and more importantly, somehwat maintainable.

Most of the patches are relatively minor things to undo copy+paste
issues.  Patch 1/15 adds an option to run a specific test, which is
