#### [PATCH v4 0/5] KVM: LAPIC: Implement Exitless Timer
##### From: Wanpeng Li <kernellwp@gmail.com>
X-Google-Original-From: Wanpeng Li <wanpengli@tencent.com>

```c

Dedicated instances are currently disturbed by unnecessary jitter due 
to the emulated lapic timers fire on the same pCPUs which vCPUs resident.
There is no hardware virtual timer on Intel for guest like ARM. Both 
programming timer in guest and the emulated timer fires incur vmexits.
This patchset tries to avoid vmexit which is incurred by the emulated 
timer fires in dedicated instance scenario. 

When nohz_full is enabled in dedicated instances scenario, the unpinned 
timer will be moved to the nearest busy housekeepers after commit
9642d18eee2cd (nohz: Affine unpinned timers to housekeepers) and commit 
444969223c8 ("sched/nohz: Fix affine unpinned timers mess"). However, 
KVM always makes lapic timer pinned to the pCPU which vCPU residents, the 
reason is explained by commit 61abdbe0 (kvm: x86: make lapic hrtimer 
pinned). Actually, these emulated timers can be offload to the housekeeping 
cpus since APICv is really common in recent years. The guest timer interrupt 
is injected by posted-interrupt which is delivered by housekeeping cpu 
once the emulated timer fires. 

The host admin should fine tuned, e.g. dedicated instances scenario w/ 
nohz_full cover the pCPUs which vCPUs resident, several pCPUs surplus 
for busy housekeeping, disable mwait/hlt/pause vmexits to keep in non-root  
mode, ~3% redis performance benefit can be observed on Skylake server.

v3 -> v4:
 * drop the HRTIMER_MODE_ABS_PINNED, add kick after set pending timer
 * don't posted inject already-expired timer

v2 -> v3:
 * disarming the vmx preemption timer when posted_interrupt_inject_timer_enabled()
 * check kvm_hlt_in_guest instead

v1 -> v2:
 * check vcpu_halt_in_guest
 * move module parameter from kvm-intel to kvm
 * add housekeeping_enabled
 * rename apic_timer_expired_pi to kvm_apic_inject_pending_timer_irqs

Wanpeng Li (5):
  KVM: LAPIC: Make lapic timer unpinned
  KVM: LAPIC: inject lapic timer interrupt by posted interrupt
  KVM: LAPIC: Ignore timer migration when lapic timer is injected by pi
  KVM: LAPIC: Don't posted inject already-expired timer
  KVM: LAPIC: add advance timer support to pi_inject_timer

#### [QEMU PATCH v3 0/9]: KVM: i386: Add support for save and restore of
##### From: Liran Alon <liran.alon@oracle.com>

```c

Hi,

This series aims to add support for QEMU to be able to migrate VMs that
are running nested hypervisors. In order to do so, it utilizes the new
IOCTLs introduced in KVM commit 8fcc4b5923af ("kvm: nVMX: Introduce
KVM_CAP_NESTED_STATE") which was created for this purpose.

1st patch introduce kvm_arch_destroy_vcpu() to perform per-vCPU
destruction logic that is arch-dependent.

2st patch is just refactoring to use symbolic constants instead of hard-coded
numbers.

3st patch fixes QEMU to update DR6 when QEMU re-inject #DB to guest after
it was intercepted by KVM when guest is debugged.

4th patch adds migration blocker for vCPU exposed with either Intel VMX
or AMD SVM. Until now it was blocked only for Intel VMX.

5rd patch updates linux-headers to have updated struct kvm_nested_state.
The updated struct now have explicit fields for the data portion.

6rd patch add vmstate support for saving/restoring kernel integer types (e.g. __u16).

7th patch adds support for saving and restoring nested state in order to migrate
guests which run a nested hypervisor.

8th patch add support for KVM_CAP_EXCEPTION_PAYLOAD. This new KVM capability
allows userspace to properly distingiush between pending and injecting exceptions.

9th patch reverts a past commit which have added a migration blocker when guest
is exposed with VMX. Remaining with only a migration blocker for vCPU
exposed with AMD SVM.

Regards,
-Liran

v1->v2 changes:
* Add patch to fix bug when re-inject #DB to guest.
* Add support for KVM_CAP_EXCEPTION_PAYLOAD.
* Use explicit fields for struct kvm_nested_state data portion.
* Use vmstate subsections to save/restore nested state in order to properly
* support forward & backwards migration compatability.
* Remove VMX migration blocker.

v2->v3 changes:
* Add kvm_arch_destroy_vcpu().
* Use DR6_BS where appropriate.
* Add cpu_pre_save() logic to convert pending exception to injected
  exception if guest is running L2.
* Converted max_nested_state_len to int instead of uint32_t.
* Use kvm_arch_destroy_vcpu() to free nested_state.
* Add migration blocker for vCPU exposed with AMD SVM.
* Don't rely on CR4 or MSR_EFER to know if it is required to
migrate new VMState subsections.
* Signal if vCPU is in guest-mode in hflags as original intention by Paolo.
