#### [PATCH 0/3] KVM: Unify mmu_memory_cache functionality across
##### From: Christoffer Dall <christoffer.dall@arm.com>

```c

We currently have duplicated functionality for the mmu_memory_cache used
to pre-allocate memory for the page table manipulation code which cannot
allocate memory while holding spinlocks.  This functionality is
duplicated across x86, arm/arm64, and mips.

There were recently a debate of modifying the arm code to be more in
line with the x86 code and some discussions around changing the page
flags used for allocation.  This series should make it easier to take a
uniform approach across architectures.

While there's not a huge amount of code sharing, we come out with a net
gain.

Only tested on arm/arm64, and only compile-tested on x86 and mips.

Christoffer Dall (3):
  KVM: x86: Move mmu_memory_cache functions to common code
  KVM: arm/arm64: Move to common kvm_mmu_memcache infrastructure
  KVM: mips: Move to common kvm_mmu_memcache infrastructure
