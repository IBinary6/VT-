Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v3: Group0 SGI support
Date: Fri, 10 Aug 2018 11:14:18 +0100

Although we now have Group0 support, we still miss support for Group0
SGIs (which amounts to handling ICC_SGI0R_EL1 and ICC_ASGI1R_EL1
traps), and this small series adds such support.

I appreciate this is *very* late for 4.19, yet I'd like to take it in
as they complement Christoffer's Group0 support, and It'd be annoying
to have something incomplete in 4.19.

Please shout if you spot something that doesn't look quite right.

Thanks,

	M.

* From v1:
  - Clarified the condition for which a G1 SGI can be queued
  - Added ABs abd RBs from Christoffer and Eric
