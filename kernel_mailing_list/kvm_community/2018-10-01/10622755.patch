Subject: [PATCH 0/2] KVM: VMX: clean up virtual APIC control handling

The immediate goal of this series is to fix a VMWRITE warning that
occurs on older hardware due to accessing secondary exec controls
when the field is not supported[1].  While inspecting the related
code, I found that the offending commit that introduced the bug also
unintentionally changed nested guest behavior when the FlexPriority
module param is disabled.  KVM's handling of the FlexPriority param
is so inconsistent and unintuitive that removing the param altogether
seemed to be the simplest way to revert back to the previous behavior
while keeping its bugfix intact.
