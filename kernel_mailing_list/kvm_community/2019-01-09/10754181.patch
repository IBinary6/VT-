Subject: [PATCH 0/3] arm64: KVM: Allow direct function calls on VHE
Date: Wed,  9 Jan 2019 13:54:32 +0000

It recently appeared that the nasty hack we use to call a HYP function
on a non-VHE system has an interesting side effect on VHE: We wrap any
such call into a hypercall, losing any form of type checking between
the caller and the callee.

This isn't a big deal if you can guarantee to write code that is
always 100% correct, but it appears that I'm not you.

In order to restore some sanity, let's use the following property: On
a VHE system, it is always possible to call any function directly as
they live in the same address space. We can thus always emit a direct
call, and use a static key to flip from one to the other. As a bonus,
this also sanitizes !VHE systems as we always generate code for noth
revisions of the architecture.

Marc Zyngier (3):
  arm/arm64: KVM: Introduce kvm_call_hyp_ret()
  arm64: KVM: Allow for direct call of HYP functions when using VHE
  arm64: KVM: Drop VHE-specific HYP call stub
