Subject: [PATCH v4 00/14] KVM/X86: Introduce a new guest mapping interface
Date: Mon,  3 Dec 2018 10:30:53 +0100

Guest memory can either be directly managed by the kernel (i.e. have a "struct
page") or they can simply live outside kernel control (i.e. do not have a
"struct page"). KVM mostly support these two modes, except in a few places
where the code seems to assume that guest memory must have a "struct page".

This patchset introduces a new mapping interface to map guest memory into host
kernel memory which also supports PFN-based memory (i.e. memory without 'struct
page'). It also converts all offending code to this interface or simply
read/write directly from guest memory.

As far as I can see all offending code is now fixed except the APIC-access page
which I will handle in a seperate series along with dropping
kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_page and kvm_vcpu_gpa_to_page from the internal KVM API.

The current implementation of the new API uses memremap to map memory that does
not have a "struct page". This proves to be very slow for high frequency
mappings. Since this does not affect the normal use-case where a "struct page"
is available, the performance of this API will be handled by a seperate patch
series.

v3 -> v4:
- Rebase
- Add a new patch to also fix the newly introduced enhanced VMCS.

v2 -> v3:
- Rebase
- Add a new patch to also fix the newly introduced shadow VMCS.
