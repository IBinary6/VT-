Subject: [PATCH 0/2] KVM: x86: Fix PV IPIs for 32-bit KVM host
Date: Wed, 23 Jan 2019 09:22:38 -0800

KVM's paravirtual IPI hypercall is completely broken on 32-bit hosts
due to the invocation of kvm_pv_send_ipi() being wrapped with
"#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64".  All evidence points to this being an
inadvertent change that was introduced in v2 of the series[1] when
kvm_pv_send_ipi() was reworked, e.g. the initial version[2] wired
up the function for all x86 flavors and kvm_pv_send_ipi() itself
differentiates between 32-bit and 64-bit hosts.

The second patch adds checks on the result of the PV IPI hypercall in
the guest to aid in triaging failures, e.g. when running on 32-bit KVM
hosts that have not been fixed.
