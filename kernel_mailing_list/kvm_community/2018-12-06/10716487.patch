Subject: [PATCH v3 0/8] Workaround for Cortex-A76 erratum 1165522
Date: Thu,  6 Dec 2018 17:31:18 +0000

Early Cortex-A76 suffer from an erratum that can result in invalid
TLBs when the CPU speculatively executes an AT instruction in the
middle of a guest world switch, while the guest virtual memory
configuration is in an inconsistent state.

We handle this issue by mandating the use of VHE and making sure that
the guest context is fully installed before switching HCR_EL2.TGE to
zero. This ensures that a speculated AT instruction is either executed
on the host context (TGE set) or the guest context (TGE clear), and
that there is no intermediate state.

There is some additional complexity in the TLB invalidation code,
where we most make sure that a speculated AT instruction cannot mess
the stage-1 TLBs.

* From v2:
  - Dropped a bunch of spurious ISBs after James review
  - Added James RBs.

* From v1:
  - VHE TLB invalidation now atomic
  - Avoid speculated AT during TLB invalidation
  - Addressed most comments from Christoffer
  - Resplit to ease reviewing
