Hi,

I did not integrate all my patches for state handling like I had
before but just two patches which seems interresting to me:

- The first one allows the device ti be used only when a guest
  is currently using it.
  Otherwise the device is in NOT_OPER state
 
- The second rework the sch_event callback: AFAIU we can not
  consider that the event moves the device in IDLE state.
  I think we better let it as it is currently.

Regards,
Pierre
