The goal of the patches of this serie is to clarify the code
of state/event handling.

- First patch (already acked/applied) makes sure that every structures are initialized
  before the mediated device is registered.
  (Only here to apply the serie on the main tree).

- vfio: ccw: Rework subchannel state on setup
  makes sure that the device can not be used before a guest is
  ready to drive it.

- vfio: ccw: Rework subchannel state on removing
  could be squash with the previous: same kind of rewriting
  but for the removing/release callbacks.

- vfio: ccw: Rework subchannel state on sch_event
  sch_event handling seems quite poor to me.
  Anyway, I do not understand why we hould have state change there.

- vfio: ccw: Documenting state transitions

- vfio: ccw: serialize the write system calls
  Quite independent of the previous patches, this makes sure
  that the entry in the driver is serialized.

Pierre Morel (6):
  vfio: ccw: Register mediated device once all structures are
    initialized
  vfio: ccw: Rework subchannel state on setup
  vfio: ccw: Rework subchannel state on removing
  vfio: ccw: Rework subchannel state on sch_event
  vfio: ccw: Documenting state transitions
  vfio: ccw: serialize the write system calls
