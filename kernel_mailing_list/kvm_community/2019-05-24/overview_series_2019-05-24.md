#### [PATCH 1/3] MAINTAINERS: KVM: arm/arm64: Remove myself as maintainer
##### From: Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>

```c
From: Christoffer Dall <christoffer.dall@arm.com>

I no longer have time to actively review patches and manage the tree and
it's time to make that official.

Huge thanks to the incredible Linux community and all the contributors
who have put up with me over the past years.

I also take this opportunity to remove the website link to the Columbia
web page, as that information is no longer up to date and I don't know
who manages that anymore.

#### [GIT PULL] KVM/arm updates for 5.2-rc2
##### From: Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>

```c
Paolo, Radim,

This is the first batch of KVM/arm fixes for 5.2. The biggest item on
the menu is Christoffer removing himself from the MAINTAINERS
file. He'll be missed. The rest is a set of fixes moving some code
around to prevent KASAN and co from crashing the kernel on non-VHE
systems.

Please pull,

	M.

From: James Morse <james.morse@arm.com>

KVM's pmu.c contains the __hyp_text needed to switch the pmu registers
between host and guest. Because this isn't covered by the 'hyp' Makefile,
it can be built with kasan and friends when these are enabled in Kconfig.

When starting a guest, this results in:

This is caused by functions in pmu.c calling the instrumented

#### [PATCH] KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: introduce a KVM device lock
##### From: =?utf-8?q?C=C3=A9dric_Le_Goater?= <clg@kaod.org>

```c
The XICS-on-XIVE KVM device needs to allocate XIVE event queues when a
priority is used by the OS. This is referred as EQ provisioning and it
is done under the hood when :

  1. a CPU is hot-plugged in the VM
  2. the "set-xive" is called at VM startup
  3. sources are restored at VM restore

The kvm->lock mutex is used to protect the different XIVE structures
being modified but in some contextes, kvm->lock is taken under the
vcpu->mutex which is a forbidden sequence by KVM.

Introduce a new mutex 'lock' for the KVM devices for them to
synchronize accesses to the XIVE device structures.

kselftests exposed a problem in the s390 handling for memory slots.
Right now we only do proper memory slot handling for creation of new

implement those.

#### mm/compaction: BUG: NULL pointer dereference
##### From: Suzuki K Poulose <suzuki.poulose@arm.com>

```c
Hi,

We are hitting NULL pointer dereferences while running stress tests with KVM.
See splat [0]. The test is to spawn 100 VMs all doing standard debian
installation (Thanks to Marc's automated scripts, available here [1] ).
The problem has been reproduced with a better rate of success from 5.1-rc6
onwards.

The issue is only reproducible with swapping enabled and the entire
memory is used up, when swapping heavily. Also this issue is only reproducible
on only one server with 128GB, which has the following memory layout:

[32GB@4GB, hole , 96GB@544GB]

Here is my non-expert analysis of the issue so far.

Under extreme memory pressure, the kswapd could trigger reset_isolation_suitable()
to figure out the cached values for migrate/free pfn for a zone, by scanning through
the entire zone. On our server it does so in the range of [ 0x10_0000, 0xa00_0000 ],
with the following area of holes : [ 0x20_0000, 0x880_0000 ].
In the failing case, we end up setting the cached migrate pfn as : 0x508_0000, which
is right in the center of the zone pfn range. i.e ( 0x10_0000 + 0xa00_0000 ) / 2,
with reset_migrate = 0x88_4e00, reset_free = 0x10_0000.

Now these cached values are used by the fast_isolate_freepages() to find a pfn. However,
since we cant find anything during the search we fall back to using the page belonging
to the min_pfn (which is the migrate_pfn), without proper checks to see if that is valid
PFN or not. This is then passed on to fast_isolate_around() which tries to do :
set_pageblock_skip(page) on the page which blows up due to an NULL mem_section pointer.

The following patch seems to fix the issue for me, but I am not quite convinced that
it is the right fix. Thoughts ?

#### [PATCH] mm, compaction: Make sure we isolate a valid PFN
##### From: Suzuki K Poulose <suzuki.poulose@arm.com>

```c
When we have holes in a normal memory zone, we could endup having
cached_migrate_pfns which may not necessarily be valid, under heavy memory
pressure with swapping enabled ( via __reset_isolation_suitable(), triggered
by kswapd).

Later if we fail to find a page via fast_isolate_freepages(), we may
end up using the migrate_pfn we started the search with, as valid
page. This could lead to accessing NULL pointer derefernces like below,
due to an invalid mem_section pointer.

 ---[ end trace af6a35219325a9b6 ]---

The issue was reported on an arm64 server with 128GB with holes in the zone
(e.g, [32GB@4GB, 96GB@544GB]), with a swap device enabled, while running 100 KVM
guest instances.

This patch fixes the issue by ensuring that the page belongs to a valid PFN
when we fallback to using the lower limit of the scan range upon failure in
fast_isolate_freepages().

#### [PATCH v2] mm: add account_locked_vm utility function
##### From: Daniel Jordan <daniel.m.jordan@oracle.com>

```c
locked_vm accounting is done roughly the same way in five places, so
unify them in a helper.  Standardize the debug prints, which vary
slightly, but include the helper's caller to disambiguate between
callsites.

Error codes stay the same, so user-visible behavior does too.  The one
exception is that the -EPERM case in tce_account_locked_vm is removed
because Alexey has never seen it triggered.

#### [PATCHv4 1/3] vfio/mdev: Improve the create/remove sequence
##### From: Parav Pandit <parav@mellanox.com>

```c
This patch addresses below two issues and prepares the code to address
3rd issue listed below.

1. mdev device is placed on the mdev bus before it is created in the
vendor driver. Once a device is placed on the mdev bus without creating
its supporting underlying vendor device, mdev driver's probe() gets triggered.
However there isn't a stable mdev available to work on.

   create_store()
     mdev_create_device()
       device_register()
          ...
         vfio_mdev_probe()
        [...]
        parent->ops->create()
          vfio_ap_mdev_create()
            mdev_set_drvdata(mdev, matrix_mdev);
            /* Valid pointer set above */

Due to this way of initialization, mdev driver who wants to use the mdev,
doesn't have a valid mdev to work on.

2. Current creation sequence is,
   parent->ops_create()
   groups_register()

Remove sequence is,
   parent->ops->remove()
   groups_unregister()

However, remove sequence should be exact mirror of creation sequence.
Once this is achieved, all users of the mdev will be terminated first
before removing underlying vendor device.
(Follow standard linux driver model).
At that point vendor's remove() ops shouldn't fail because taking the
device off the bus should terminate any usage.

3. When remove operation fails, mdev sysfs removal attempts to add the
file back on already removed device. Following call trace [1] is observed.

[1] call trace:
kernel: WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 9348 at fs/sysfs/file.c:327 sysfs_create_file_ns+0x7f/0x90
kernel: CPU: 2 PID: 9348 Comm: bash Kdump: loaded Not tainted 5.1.0-rc6-vdevbus+ #6
kernel: Hardware name: Supermicro SYS-6028U-TR4+/X10DRU-i+, BIOS 2.0b 08/09/2016
kernel: RIP: 0010:sysfs_create_file_ns+0x7f/0x90
kernel: Call Trace:
kernel: remove_store+0xdc/0x100 [mdev]
kernel: kernfs_fop_write+0x113/0x1a0
kernel: vfs_write+0xad/0x1b0
kernel: ksys_write+0x5a/0xe0
kernel: do_syscall_64+0x5a/0x210
kernel: entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x49/0xbe

Therefore, mdev core is improved in following ways.

1. Split the device registration/deregistration sequence so that some
things can be done between initialization of the device and
hooking it up to the bus respectively after deregistering it
from the bus but before giving up our final reference.
In particular, this means invoking the ->create and ->remove
callbacks in those new windows. This gives the vendor driver an
initialized mdev device to work with during creation.
At the same time, a bus driver who wish to bind to mdev driver also
gets initialized mdev device.

This follows standard Linux kernel bus and device model.

2. During remove flow, first remove the device from the bus. This
ensures that any bus specific devices are removed.
Once device is taken off the mdev bus, invoke remove() of mdev
from the vendor driver.

3. The driver core device model provides way to register and auto
unregister the device sysfs attribute groups at dev->groups.
Make use of dev->groups to let core create the groups and eliminate
code to avoid explicit groups creation and removal.

To ensure, that new sequence is solid, a below stack dump of a
process is taken who attempts to remove the device while device is in
use by vfio driver and user application.
This stack dump validates that vfio driver guards against such device
removal when device is in use.

 cat /proc/21962/stack
[<0>] vfio_del_group_dev+0x216/0x3c0 [vfio]
[<0>] mdev_remove+0x21/0x40 [mdev]

[<0>] vfs_write+0xad/0x1b0

[<0>] do_syscall_64+0x5a/0x210
[<0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x49/0xbe
[<0>] 0xffffffffffffffff

This prepares the code to eliminate calling device_create_file() in
subsequent patch.

Use one generic vhost_copy_to_user() instead of two dedicated
accessor. This will simplify the conversion to fine grain
accessors. About 2% improvement of PPS were seen during vitio-user

#### [PATCH v2 1/2] x86/cpu: Add support for UMONITOR/UMWAIT/TPAUSE
##### From: Tao Xu <tao3.xu@intel.com>

```c
UMONITOR, UMWAIT and TPAUSE are a set of user wait instructions.
Availability of the user wait instructions is indicated by the presence
of the CPUID feature flag WAITPKG CPUID.0x07.0x0:ECX[5].

The patch enable the umonitor, umwait and tpause features in KVM.
Because umwait and tpause can put a (psysical) CPU into a power saving
state, by default we dont't expose it in kvm and provide a capability to
enable it. Use kvm capability to enable UMONITOR, UMWAIT and TPAUSE when
QEMU use "-overcommit cpu-pm=on, a VM can use UMONITOR, UMWAIT and TPAUSE
instructions. If the instruction causes a delay, the amount of time
delayed is called here the physical delay. The physical delay is first
computed by determining the virtual delay (the time to delay relative to
the VMâs timestamp counter). Otherwise, UMONITOR, UMWAIT and TPAUSE cause
an invalid-opcode exception(#UD).
