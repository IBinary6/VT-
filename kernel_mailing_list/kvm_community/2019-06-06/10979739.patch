This patch adds a very rough implementation of additional config data
for mdev devices. The idea is to make it possible to specify some
type-specific key=value pairs in the config file for an mdev device.
If a device is started automatically, the device is stopped and restarted
after applying the config.

The code has still some problems, like not doing a lot of error handling
and being ugly in general; but most importantly, I can't really test it,
as I don't have the needed hardware. Feedback welcome; would be good to
know if the direction is sensible in general.
