Subject: [PATCH kvmtool 0/2] Add terminal detach feature
Date: Fri,  5 Jul 2019 10:59:12 +0100

At the moment running a guest will tie it to the console where kvmtool
is running on. So one cannot logout of the terminal without killing the
guest. Existing workarounds are running in a terminal multiplexer like
screen or using the --tty option to detach kvmtool from the very
beginning.

Both of these solutions need to be invoked at guest creation time,
though. Patch 2 introduces a "detach" command, which can be invoked at
any point during the guest's runtime using the terminal escape sequence
("Ctrl+A d" by default). This will redirect the guest's serial output
to pseudo-terminals and detach the process from the console. More
details in the commit message.

Patch 1 contains a bugfix, which avoids the kvmtool terminal thread to
hog the full CPU time because poll() is not exactly doing what we think
it does.

Please have a look and comment!

Cheers,
Andre
