Hi,

The Mediate Device is a framework for fine-grained physical device
sharing across the isolated domains. Currently the mdev framework
is designed to be independent of the platform IOMMU support. As the
result, the DMA isolation relies on the mdev parent device in a
vendor specific way.

There are several cases where a mediated device could be protected
and isolated by the platform IOMMU. For example, Intel vt-d rev3.0
[1] introduces a new translation mode called 'scalable mode', which
enables PASID-granular translations. The vt-d scalable mode is the
key ingredient for Scalable I/O Virtualization [2] [3] which allows
sharing a device in minimal possible granularity (ADI - Assignable
Device Interface).

A mediated device backed by an ADI could be protected and isolated
by the IOMMU since 1) the parent device supports tagging an unique
PASID to all DMA traffic out of the mediated device; and 2) the DMA
translation unit (IOMMU) supports the PASID granular translation.
We can apply IOMMU protection and isolation to this kind of devices
just as what we are doing with an assignable PCI device.

In order to distinguish the IOMMU-capable mediated devices from those
which still need to rely on parent devices, this patch set adds a
domain type attribute to each mdev.

enum mdev_domain_type {
	DOMAIN_TYPE_NO_IOMMU,	/* Don't need any IOMMU support.
				 * All isolation and protection
				 * are handled by the parent
				 * device driver with a device
				 * specific mechanism.
				 */
	DOMAIN_TYPE_ATTACH_PARENT, /* IOMMU can isolate and protect
				    * the mdev, and the isolation
				    * domain should be attaced with
				    * the parent device.
				    */
};

The mdev parent device driver could opt-in whether an mdev is IOMMU
capable when the device is created by invoking below interface within
its @create callback:

int mdev_set_domain_type(struct device *dev,
                         enum mdev_domain_type type);

In the vfio_iommu_type1_attach_group(), a domain allocated through
iommu_domain_alloc() will be attached to the mdev parent device if
the domain types of mdev devices in group are of type ATTACH_PARENT;
Otherwise, the dummy external domain will be used and all the DMA
isolation and protection are routed to parent driver as the result.

On IOMMU side, a basic requirement is allowing to attach multiple
domains for a PCI device if the device advertises the capability
and the IOMMU hardware supports finer granularity translations than
the normal PCI Source ID based translation.

In order for the ease of discussion, we call "a domain in auxiliary
mode' or simply 'an auxiliary domain' when a domain is attached to
a device for finer granularity translations (than the Source ID based
one). But we need to keep in mind that this doesn't mean two types of
domains. A same domain could be bound to a device for Source ID based
translation, and bound to another device for finer granularity
translation at the same time.

Below APIs are introduced in the IOMMU glue for device drivers to use
the finer granularity translation.

* iommu_capable(IOMMU_CAP_AUX_DOMAIN)
  - Represents the ability for supporting multiple domains per device
    (a.k.a. finer granularity translations) of the IOMMU hardware.
    
* iommu_en(dis)able_aux_domain(struct device *dev)
  - Enable/disable the multiple domains capability for a device
    referenced by @dev.

* iommu_auxiliary_id(struct iommu_domain *domain)
  - Return the index value used for finer-granularity DMA translation.
    The specific device driver needs to feed the hardware with this
    value, so that hardware device could issue the DMA transaction with
    this value tagged.

This patch series extends both IOMMU and vfio components to support
mdev device passing through when it could be isolated and protected
by the IOMMU units. The first part of this series (PATCH 1/10 ~ 6/10)
adds the interfaces and implementation of the multiple domains per
device. The second part (PATCH 7/12 ~ 10/12) adds the domain type
attribute to each mdev, determines domain type according to the
attribute when attaching group in vfio type1 iommu module, and bind
an auxiliary domain for the group with all mediated devices which
requires its own domain.

This patch series depends on a patch set posted here [4] for discussion
which added the support for scalable mode in Intel IOMMU driver.
