Hi Connie, Pierre,

This is a first round of rework to vfio-ccw that I've been cooking to
make the channel program handler easier to understand.  My apologies
for the number of patches; as there are some intersections within them
I couldn't break them up without forcing them to be applied in a
particular order.  I imagine that since there will probably need to be
some discussion, an RFC tag makes sense and one giant series will be
fine for now.  I can break them up for later versions if desired.

(Sidebar: I'm leaving next Thursday for an early start on the US
Thanksgiving holiday.  So if you are busy and can't get to this,
no problem!  Now where did I leave Pierre's rework patches...  :)

Patch summary:

1-2:	Fixes for cleanup on error paths
3:	Code simplication
4-6:	Simplify the ccwchain processing
7-10:	Simplify the pfn_array processing

The first few patches are very straightforward, if unlikely to occur.
They could even be considered candidates for 4.20, if so inclined.

The ccwchain patches are the result of two observations about how we
currently process a channel program and its component CCWs.  One is a
duplicate set of code for a Transfer In Channel (TIC) CCW versus any
other type, which provides an easy opportunity for simplification when
all it's trying to handle is a memory jump.  The other is a duplication
between a direct-addressed CCW and an Indirect Data Address (IDA) CCW.
There is currently the nuance that the direct CCW path creates:

  ch_pat->pfn_array_table[1]->pfn_array[#pages]

while an IDA CCW creates:

  ch_pat->pfn_array_table[#idaws]->pfn_array[1]

It might not be obvious, but #pages is calculated identically to #idaws,
as highlighted by patch 7.  By removing these duplications, we set the
stage for the next patches, which can eliminate an array entirely.

The pfn_array patches permit a non-contiguous array of addresses to be
passed to pfn_array_alloc(_pin), which in turn permits the removal of
struct pfn_array_table and a squashing of our arrays.  Thus, instead of
either of the two nested arrays described above, we have:

  ch_pa->pfn_array[#idaws]

(Doesn't that look nice?!)

The last two patches in this series should be squashed together; I just
left them apart in the RFC to make it easier to see how turn-key this
becomes after the complexities of the previous patches, and without the
noise of realigning the code afterward.  (Sorry, kbuild robot.)

While this series provides no functionality changes, I find that
sizeof(vfio_ccw.ko) decreases by about 7 percent according to the
bloat-o-meter, and we remove some of the malloc load for a given
channel program.  Hopefully there's also an increase in Readability,
Understandability, and Maintainability too!

Eric Farman (10):
  s390/cio: Fix cleanup of pfn_array alloc failure
  s390/cio: Fix cleanup when unsupported IDA format is used
  s390/cio: Squash cp_free and cp_unpin_free
  s390/cio: Breakout the processing of a channel program
  s390/cio: Use common channel program processor for TIC
  s390/cio: Combine ccwchain_fetch _idal and _direct
  s390/cio: Tell pfn_array_alloc_pin to pin pages, not bytes
  s390/cio: Split pfn_array_alloc_pin into pieces
  s390/cio: Eliminate the pfn_array_table struct
  s390/cio: Remove unused function/variables FIXUP
