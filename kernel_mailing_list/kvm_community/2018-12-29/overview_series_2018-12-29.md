#### [RFC PATCH V3 1/5] vhost: generalize adding used elem
##### From: Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com>

```c
Use one generic vhost_copy_to_user() instead of two dedicated
accessor. This will simplify the conversion to fine grain
accessors. About 2% improvement of PPS were seen during vitio-user
txonly test.
