Notes:
=====

Patches 1-2 (by David) are posted with this series because they are not
currently available in our master branch, upon which this series is based,
and because this series is dependent upon them.  

This patch series works with the v8 QEMU patches.

Abstract:
========

On s390, we have cryptographic coprocessor cards, which are modeled on
Linux as devices on the AP bus. Each card can be partitioned into domains
which can be thought of as a set of hardware registers for processing 
crypto commands. Crypto commands are sent to a specific domain within a
card is via a queue which is identified as a (card,domain) tuple. We model 
this something like the following (assuming we have access to cards 3 and 
4 and domains 1 and 2):

AP -> card3 -> queue (3,1)
            -> queue (3,2)
   -> card4 -> queue (4,1)
            -> queue (4,2)

If we want to virtualize this, we can use a feature provided by the
hardware. We basically attach a satellite control block to our main
hardware virtualization control block and the hardware takes care of
most of the rest.

For this control block, we don't specify explicit tuples, but a list of
cards and a list of domains. The guest will get access to the cross
product.

Because of this, we need to take care that the lists provided to
different guests don't overlap; i.e., we need to enforce sane
configurations. Otherwise, one guest may get access to things like
secret keys for another guest.

The idea of this patch set is to introduce a new device, the matrix
device. This matrix device hangs off a different root and acts as the
parent node for mdev devices.

If you now want to give the tuples (4,1) and (4,2), you need to do the
following:

- Make sure the queues (4,1) and (4,2) belong to vfio_ap (see patches
  #5 and #6)
- Create the mediated device.
- Assign card 4 and domains 1 and 2 to the mediated device
- Optionally activate the mediated device.

QEMU will now simply consume the mediated device and things should work.

For a complete description of the architecture and concepts underlying
the design, see the Documentation/s390/vfio-ap.txt file included with this
patch set.

v10 => v11 Change log:
=====================
* Fixed race condition when setting KVM in the notifier
* Removed KVM_S390_VM_CPU_FEAT_AP, no longer necessary
* Fail vfio_ap module inti if AP instructions not available on host
* Remove KVM_S390_VM_CPU_FEAT_AP
* Expose VM enable/disable APIE attributes only if AP instructions
  available on host.

v9 => v10 Change log:
===================
* Replaced statically allocated with dynamically allocated matrix device
* Made changes to drivers/iommu/Kconfig and arch/s390/Kconfig to fix the
  dependency chain so that make menuconfig can be used to configure VFIO_AP
* Added KVM device attributes to enable/disable hw interpretation of AP
  instructions from userspace.
* Return more meaningful error values from mediated matrix device
  assignment sysfs interfaces
* No longer enforcing convention that the ADM is a superset of the AQM at
  for guest level 2
* Broke 2 vSIE patches into several to make it easier to review them
* Reworked vSIE patches to handle various CRYCB formats
v8 => v9 Change log:
===================
* Removed /sys/devices/virtual/misc/vfio_ap device and restored 
  /sys/devices/vfio_ap/matrix device as parent of mediated matrix devices
* Return boolean from ap_configuration_available() in ap.h instead of 0 or
  an error.
* Miscellaneous changes due to review comments 

v7 => v8 Change log:
===================
* Removed the AP bus gained the ability to designate queues as 'used by
  host' or as 'used by alternate driver(s)'. 
* Removed 'activate' attribute from mediated device.
* Do consistency checking during device assignment:
  1. Verify that APQNs assigned to the mediated device are bound to the 
     VFIO AP device driver
  2. Verify that no APQN assigned to the mediated matrix device is assigned
     to any other mediated matrix device.
* The attributes of a mediated matrix device that is in use by a guest can
  not be changed - i.e., no device assignment/unassignment allowed
* A mediated matrix device that is in use by a guest can not be removed.
* Removed all printk logging from VFIO AP driver; allowing return codes
  from interfaces to describe the error.
* Reworked the handling of the CRYCB in vSIE based upon patches introduced
  by David in the mainline. 

v6 => v7 Change log:
===================
* The AP bus gained the ability to designate queues as 'used by host'
  or as 'used by alternate driver(s)'. This allows us to authorise access
  (via the CRYCB) to queues that are not currently bound to the vfio_ap
  driver. If a  vfio_ap owned queue diss- and reapears it's guaranteed
  to get bound back to the vfio_ap driver.
* The mediated device gained an 'activate' attribute. Sharing conflicts are
  checked on activation now. If the device was not activated, the mdev
  open still implies activation. An active ap_matrix_mdev device claims
  it's resources -- an inactive does not.
* An active ap_matrix_mdev device can not be removed. An ap_matrix_mdev
  that is hooked up with a guest can not be deactivated.
* An active ap_matrix_mdev device rejects assign_* and deassign_*
  operations. Thus changing the CRYCB masks of a guest in order to
  accomplys certain hotplug scenarios is planned, but not supported yet. In
  previous versions it was possible to do those operations on a ap_matrix_mdev
  that is hooked up to a guest, but the changes would take effect on the next
  mdev_open. 
* Synchronisation was reworked.
* The sysfs path of the parent device changed from /sys/devices/vfio_ap/matrix/
  to /sys/devices/virtual/misc/vfio_ap/. The parent device is a misc
  device now.
* The severity for most of the messages were reduced form error to
  warning.
*  We are not as thick headed about the zapq as we used to be in v6.

v5 => v6 Change log:
===================
* Added VSIE support - thanks to Pierre Morel
* Added VFIO_DEVICE_RESET ioctl
* Zeroizing AP queues when mediated device released and when 
  VFIO_DEVICE_RESET ioctl is invoked
* Removed /arch/s390/kvm/kvm-ap.c and arch/s390/include/asm/kvm-ap.h and
  moved guest matrix configuration into vfio driver
* Removed temporary interfaces to be supplied by AP bus
* Made the variable that keeps track of mdev instance count an atomic_t
  type
* Removed code iterating through vm_list to determine if another guest has
  a queue .... not keep a list of matrix_mdev devices and verify against
  that list. Removes the need for the kvm_lock.
* Added a sysfs attribute for the mediated matrix device to display the
  matrix contained in the guest's CRYCB if a guest is using the mdev.


v4 => v5 Change log:
===================
* Verify AP queues bound to driver in mediated device open callback, prior
  to configuring the matrix in the CRYCB
* Implement VFIO_DEVICE_RESET ioctl
* Zeroize queues on guest entry and exit
* Removed vnet from all email IBM email addresses referenced
* Add synchronization in mdev create/remove and open/release.

v4 => v5 Change log:
===================
* Added code to mdev open callback to ensure not more than one vfio-ap
  device can be opened by a guest.
* Interpret AP instructions by default
* Removed patch implementing interface to enable/disable AP interpretation,
  since that will now be done by default
* Removed patch to reset crypto attributes for ALL vcpus. That will be 
  submitted as a single patch since it will not be needed in this series - 
  i.e., it was called from the interface to enable/disable AP instructions
* All code for initializing crypto for a guest has been moved back to 
  kvm-s390.c, kvm_s390_crypto_init(kvm) function
* Maintaining a module reference count for the vfio_ap module so it is not
  removed while a guest with AP devices is running.

v3 => v4 Change log:
===================
* Resolved issue with enabling ZCRYPT when KVM is enabled by using
  #ifdef ZCRYPT in relevant functions
* Added patch with a new function for resetting the crypto attributes
  for all vcpus to resolve the issue raised with running vcpus getting out 
  of sync.
* Removed KVM_S390_VM_CRYPTO_INTERPRET_AP: Setting interpretive exec mode
  from vfio_ap driver when mdev device is opened.

v2 => v3 Change log:
===================
* Set APIE in VCPU setup function
* Renamed patch 13/15:
    KVM: s390: Configure the guest's CRYCB
    KVM: s390: Configure the guest's AP devices
* Fixed problem with building arch/s390/kvm/kvm-ap.c when CONFIG_ZCRYPT
  not selected 
* Removed patch introducing VSIE support for AP pending further 
  investigation
* Initialized AP maximum mask sizes - i.e., APM, AQM and ADM - from info
  returned from PQAP(QCI) function
* Introduced a new device attribute to the KVM_S390_VM_CRYPTO attribute
  group for setting a flag via the KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR ioctl to indicate
  whether ECA_APIE should be set or not. The flag is used in the 
  kvm_s390_vcpu_crypto_setup() function to set ECA_APIE in the SIE block.
