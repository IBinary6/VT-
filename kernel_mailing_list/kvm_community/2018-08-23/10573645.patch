There was a request to support relocatable compiles (you know who you
are - and so does anybody who can read CC lists on emails.) I've also
recently had my own motivation (adding support to QEMU for a dynamic
RAM base). Here it is for arm64. I didn't do arm yet because it didn't
appear to be as easy and it's unlikely we'll want to make its RAM
base dynamic in QEMU anyway.

Thanks,
drew
