Add migration support for VFIO device

This Patch set include patches as below:
- Define KABI for VFIO device for migration support.
- Generic migration functionality for VFIO device.
  * This patch set adds functionality only for PCI devices, but can be
    extended to other VFIO devices.
  * Added all the basic functions required for pre-copy, stop-and-copy and
    resume phases of migration.
  * Added state change notifier and from that notifier function, VFIO
    device's state changed is conveyed to VFIO vendor driver.
  * During save setup phase and resume/load setup phase, migration region
    is queried from vendor driver and is mmaped by QEMU. This region is
    used to read/write data from and to vendor driver.
  * .save_live_pending, .save_live_iterate and .is_active_iterate are
    implemented to use QEMU's functionality of iteration during pre-copy
    phase.
  * In .save_live_complete_precopy, that is in stop-and-copy phase,
    iteration to read data from vendor driver is implemented till pending
    bytes returned by vendor driver are not zero.
  * .save_cleanup and .load_cleanup are implemented to unmap migration
    region that was setup duing setup phase.
  * Added function to get dirty pages bitmap from vendor driver.
- Add vfio_listerner_log_sync to mark dirty pages.
- Make VFIO PCI device migration capable.

Thanks,
Kirti
