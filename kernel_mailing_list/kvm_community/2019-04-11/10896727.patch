Subject: [PATCH v6 0/7] KVM: nVMX Add IA32_PAT consistency checks
Date: Thu, 11 Apr 2019 12:18:02 -0700

This is a continuation of Krish's series, which has suffered a teeny
tiny bit of scope creep (sorry Krish).  This is essentially a new series,
e.g. only the actual PAT-related patches, which haven't changed since v2,
are retained from previous versions.  But, to avoid unnecessary conflicts
I'm resending everything in one happy series.

The direction change relative to v5 is to self-document the top-level
consistency check functions by a) renaming the functions and b) using a
dedicated parameter to "return" the failure information, as suggested by
Paolo.  Previous versions had been taking the approach of using the return
value itself to document that a failed "postreqs" leads to a VM-Exit,
which was simply putting lipstick on a pig.

Krish Sadhukhan (2):
  Check "load IA32_PAT" VM-exit control on vmentry
  Check "load IA32_PAT" VM-entry control on vmentry

Sean Christopherson (5):
  KVM: nVMX: Move guest non-reg state checks to VM-Exit path
  KVM: nVMX: Rename and split top-level consistency checks to match SDM
  KVM: nVMX: Set VM-{Fail,Exit} failure info via params, not return val
  KVM: nVMX: Collapse nested_check_host_control_regs() into its caller
  KVM: nVMX: Return -EINVAL when signaling failure in VM-Entry helpers
