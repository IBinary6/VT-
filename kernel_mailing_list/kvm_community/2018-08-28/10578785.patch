Subject: [PATCH v2 00/18] KVM: nVMX: add option to perform early consistency
 checks via H/W
Date: Tue, 28 Aug 2018 09:04:41 -0700

KVM currently defers many VMX consistency checks to the CPU, including
checks that result in VMFail (as opposed to VMExit).  This behavior
may be undesirable for some users since this means KVM detects certain
classes of VMFail only after it has processed guest state.  Because
there is a strict ordering between checks that cause VMFail and those
that cause VMExit, i.e. all VMFail checks are performed before any
checks that cause VMExit, we can detect all VMFail conditions via a
dry run of sorts.

The end goal of this series is to add an optional (param-controlled)
pre-run VMEnter into the nested_vmx_run() flow in order to perform
all VMFail consistency checks prior to actually running vmcs02.  By
itself, this is not a complex process, but getting KVM to a point
where the approach is viable requires a fair amount of refactoring,
e.g. to split prepare_vmcs02() so that there is a point where vmcs02
can pass the VMFail checks without first consuming guest state.

And while the goal (and subject) of this series is to enable early
consistency checks, the vast majority of the series deals with bug
fixes and cleanups in the nested VMX code.  During the refactoring
and testing, a number of pre-existing bugs, opportunities for code
cleanup and easy optimization points (which unconvered more bugs)
were encountered.

Ideally, these patches would be split into 3-4 separate series,
especially the bug fix patches.  I smushed everything into a single
series because the early VMEnter code breaks without the bug fixes
and the refactoring shuffles the same code, and some of the cleanup
and fixes are inter-dependent.

Patch Synopsis:
  1-4:   bug fixes
  5-6:   optimizations
  7:     function rename
  8:     bug fix and refactoring
  9-12:  refactoring
  13-14: bug fix
  15:    refactoring
  16:    optimization and prereq for early consistency checks
  17-18: early consistency checks

v1: https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg172795.html

v2:
  - rebased on tag kvm-4.19-2
  - added patch to skip instr in nested_vmx_{fail,succeed}
