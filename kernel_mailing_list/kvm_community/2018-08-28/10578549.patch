Support for KVM_GET/SET_VCPU_EVENTS to get/set the SError exception
state, and support the state migration.

Now the VCPU event only includes the SError exception status, it can be
extended if needed. When do migration, If source machine has serror pending, 
the target machine is also needed to pend this serror regardless of whether
target machine can support to set the serror syndrome.
