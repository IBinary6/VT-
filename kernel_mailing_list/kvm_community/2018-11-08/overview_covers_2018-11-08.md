#### [PATCH v15 00/10] Add ARMv8 RAS virtualization support in QEMU
##### From: Dongjiu Geng <gengdongjiu@huawei.com>

```c

In the ARMv8 platform, the CPU error type are synchronous external
abort(SEA) and SError Interrupt (SEI). If exception happens to guest,
sometimes  guest itself do the recovery is better, because host 
does not know guest's detailed information. For example, if a guest
user-space application happen exception, host doe not which application
encounter errors.

For the ARMv8 SEA/SEI, KVM or host kernel will deliver SIGBUS or
use other interface to notify user space. After user space gets 
the notification, it will record the CPER to guest GHES buffer
for guest and inject a exception or IRQ to KVM.

In the current implement, if the SIGBUS is BUS_MCEERR_AR, we will
treat it as synchronous exception, and use ARMv8 SEA notification type
to notify guest after recording CPER for guest;

This series patches are based on Qemu 2.12, which have two parts:
1. Generate APEI/GHES table and record CPER for guest in runtime.
2. Handle the SIGBUS signal, record the CPER and fill into guest memory,
   then according to SIGBUS type(BUS_MCEERR_AR or BUS_MCEERR_AO), using
   different ACPI notification type to notify guest.

Whole solution was suggested by James(james.morse@arm.com); APEI part solution is suggested by
Laszlo(lersek@redhat.com). Shown some discussion in [1].


This series patches have already tested on ARM64 platform with RAS feature enabled:
Show the APEI part verification result in [2]
Show the BUS_MCEERR_AR SIGBUS handling verification result in [3]
---
Change since v14:
1. Remove the BUS_MCEERR_AO handling logic because this asynchronous signal was masked by main thread 
2. Address some Igor Mammedov's comments(ACPI part)
   1) change the comments for the enum AcpiHestNotifyType definition and remove ditto in patch 1
   2) change some patch commit messages and separate "APEI GHES table generation" patch to more patches.
3. Address some peter's comments(arm64 Synchronous External Abort injection)
   1) change some code notes
   2) using arm_current_el() for current EL
   2) use the helper functions for those (syn_data_abort_*).

Change since v13:
1. Move the patches that set guest ESR and inject virtual SError out of this series
2. Clean and optimize the APEI part patches 
3. Update the commit messages and add some comments for the code

Change since v12:
1. Address Paolo's comments to move HWPoisonPage definition to accel/kvm/kvm-all.c
2. Only call kvm_cpu_synchronize_state() when get the BUS_MCEERR_AR signal
3. Only add and enable GPIO-Signal and ARMv8 SEA two hardware error sources
4. Address Michael's comments to not sync SPDX from Linux kernel header file 

Change since v11:
Address James's comments(james.morse@arm.com)
1. Check whether KVM has the capability to to set ESR instead of detecting host CPU RAS capability
2. For SIGBUS_MCEERR_AR SIGBUS, use Synchronous-External-Abort(SEA) notification type
   for SIGBUS_MCEERR_AO SIGBUS, use GPIO-Signal notification


Address Shannon's comments(for ACPI part):
1. Unify hest_ghes.c and hest_ghes.h license declaration
2. Remove unnecessary including "qmp-commands.h" in hest_ghes.c
3. Unconditionally add guest APEI table based on James's comments(james.morse@arm.com) 
4. Add a option to virt machine for migration compatibility. On new virt machine it's on
   by default while off for old ones, we enabled it since 2.12
5. Refer to the ACPI spec version which introduces Hardware Error Notification first time
6. Add ACPI_HEST_NOTIFY_RESERVED notification type

Address Igor's comments(for ACPI part):
1. Add doc patch first which will describe how it's supposed to work between QEMU/firmware/guest
   OS with expected flows.
2. Move APEI diagrams into doc/spec patch
3. Remove redundant g_malloc in ghes_record_cper()
4. Use build_append_int_noprefix() API to compose whole error status block and whole APEI table, 
   and try to get rid of most structures in patch 1, as they will be left unused after that
5. Reuse something like https://github.com/imammedo/qemu/commit/3d2fd6d13a3ea298d2ee814835495ce6241d085c
   to build GAS
6. Remove much offsetof() in the function
7. Build independent tables first and only then build dependent tables passing to it pointers
   to previously build table if necessary.
8. Redefine macro GHES_ACPI_HEST_NOTIFY_RESERVED to ACPI_HEST_ERROR_SOURCE_COUNT to avoid confusion


Address Peter Maydell's comments
1. linux-headers is done as a patch of their own created using scripts/update-linux-headers.sh run against a
   mainline kernel tree 
2. Tested whether this patchset builds OK on aarch32  
3. Abstract Hwpoison page adding code  out properly into a cpu-independent source file from target/i386/kvm.c,
   such as kvm-all.c
4. Add doc-comment formatted documentation comment for new globally-visible function prototype in a header

(3) After a synchronous external abort(SEA) happen, Qemu receive a SIGBUS and 
    filled the CPER into guest GHES memory.  For example, according to above table,
    the address that contains the physical address of a block of memory that holds
    the error status data for this abort is 0x00000000785D0040
(4) the address for SEA notification error source is 0x785d80b0
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0040
    00000000785d0040: 0x785d80b0

(5) check the content of generic error status block and generic error data entry
    (qemu) xp /100x 0x785d80b0
    00000000785d80b0: 0x00000001 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000098
    00000000785d80c0: 0x00000000 0xa5bc1114 0x4ede6f64 0x833e63b8
    00000000785d80d0: 0xb1837ced 0x00000000 0x00000300 0x00000050
    00000000785d80e0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000
    00000000785d80f0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000
    00000000785d8100: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00004002
(6) check the OSPM's ACK value(for example SEA)
    /* Before OSPM acknowledges the error, check the ACK value */
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0098
    00000000785d00f0: 0x00000000

    /* After OSPM acknowledges the error, check the ACK value, it change to 1 from 0 */
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0098
    00000000785d00f0: 0x00000001

[3]: KVM deliver "BUS_MCEERR_AR" to Qemu, Qemu record the guest CPER and inject
    synchronous external abort to notify guest, then guest do the recovery.

(3) After a synchronous external abort(SEA) happen, Qemu receive a SIGBUS and 
    filled the CPER into guest GHES memory.  For example, according to above table,
    the address that contains the physical address of a block of memory that holds
    the error status data for this abort is 0x00000000785D0040
(4) the address for SEA notification error source is 0x785d80b0
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0040
    00000000785d0040: 0x785d80b0

(5) check the content of generic error status block and generic error data entry
    (qemu) xp /100x 0x785d80b0
    00000000785d80b0: 0x00000001 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000098
    00000000785d80c0: 0x00000000 0xa5bc1114 0x4ede6f64 0x833e63b8
    00000000785d80d0: 0xb1837ced 0x00000000 0x00000300 0x00000050
    00000000785d80e0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000
    00000000785d80f0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000
    00000000785d8100: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00004002
(6) check the OSPM's ACK value(for example SEA)
    /* Before OSPM acknowledges the error, check the ACK value */
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0098
    00000000785d00f0: 0x00000000

    /* After OSPM acknowledges the error, check the ACK value, it change to 1 from 0 */
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0098
    00000000785d00f0: 0x00000001

[3]: KVM deliver "BUS_MCEERR_AR" to Qemu, Qemu record the guest CPER and inject
    synchronous external abort to notify guest, then guest do the recovery.

#### [PATCH V5 00/10] x86/KVM/Hyper-v: Add HV ept tlb range flush
##### From: lantianyu1986@gmail.com

Sorry. Some patches was blocked and I try to resend via another account.

For nested memory virtualization, Hyper-v doesn't set write-protect
L1 hypervisor EPT page directory and page table node to track changes 
while it relies on guest to tell it changes via HvFlushGuestAddressLlist
hypercall. HvFlushGuestAddressLlist hypercall provides a way to flush
EPT page table with ranges which are specified by L1 hypervisor.

If L1 hypervisor uses INVEPT or HvFlushGuestAddressSpace hypercall to
flush EPT tlb, Hyper-V will invalidate associated EPT shadow page table
and sync L1's EPT table when next EPT page fault is triggered.
HvFlushGuestAddressLlist hypercall helps to avoid such redundant EPT
page fault and synchronization of shadow page table.

This patchset is rebased on the Linux 4.20-rc1 and Patch "KVM/VMX: Check
ept_pointer before flushing ept tlb".(https://www.mail-archive.com/linux
-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1798827.html).

Change since v4:
       1) Split flush address and flush list patches. This patchset only contains
       flush address patches. Will post flush list patches later.
       2) Expose function hyperv_fill_flush_guest_mapping_list()
       out of hyperv file
       3) Adjust parameter of hyperv_flush_guest_mapping_range()
       4) Reorder patchset and move Hyper-V and VMX changes ahead.

Change since v3:
        1) Remove code of updating "tlbs_dirty" in kvm_flush_remote_tlbs_with_range()
        2) Remove directly tlb flush in the kvm_handle_hva_range()
        3) Move tlb flush in kvm_set_pte_rmapp() to kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte()
        4) Combine Vitaly's "don't pass EPT configuration info to
vmx_hv_remote_flush_tlb()" fix

Change since v2:
       1) Fix comment in the kvm_flush_remote_tlbs_with_range()
       2) Move HV_MAX_FLUSH_PAGES and HV_MAX_FLUSH_REP_COUNT to
        hyperv-tlfs.h.
       3) Calculate HV_MAX_FLUSH_REP_COUNT in the macro definition
       4) Use HV_MAX_FLUSH_REP_COUNT to define length of gpa_list in
        struct hv_guest_mapping_flush_list.

Change since v1:
       1) Convert "end_gfn" of struct kvm_tlb_range to "pages" in order
          to avoid confusion as to whether "end_gfn" is inclusive or exlusive.
       2) Add hyperv tlb range struct and replace kvm tlb range struct
          with new struct in order to avoid using kvm struct in the hyperv
          code directly.


Lan Tianyu (10):
  KVM: Add tlb_remote_flush_with_range callback in kvm_x86_ops
  x86/hyper-v: Add HvFlushGuestAddressList hypercall support
  x86/Hyper-v: Add trace in the
    hyperv_nested_flush_guest_mapping_range()
  KVM/VMX: Add hv tlb range flush support
  KVM/MMU: Add tlb flush with range helper function
  KVM: Replace old tlb flush function with new one to flush a specified
    range.
  KVM: Make kvm_set_spte_hva() return int
  KVM/MMU: Move tlb flush in kvm_set_pte_rmapp() to
    kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte()
  KVM/MMU: Flush tlb directly in the kvm_set_pte_rmapp()
  KVM/MMU: Flush tlb directly in the kvm_zap_gfn_range()
