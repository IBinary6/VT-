Subject: [PATCH RESEND v15 00/10] Add ARMv8 RAS virtualization support in QEMU
Date: Thu, 8 Nov 2018 02:29:39 -0800

In the ARMv8 platform, the CPU error type are synchronous external
abort(SEA) and SError Interrupt (SEI). If exception happens to guest,
sometimes  guest itself do the recovery is better, because host 
does not know guest's detailed information. For example, if a guest
user-space application happen exception, host doe not which application
encounter errors.

For the ARMv8 SEA/SEI, KVM or host kernel will deliver SIGBUS or
use other interface to notify user space. After user space gets 
the notification, it will record the CPER to guest GHES buffer
for guest and inject a exception or IRQ to KVM.

In the current implement, if the SIGBUS is BUS_MCEERR_AR, we will
treat it as synchronous exception, and use ARMv8 SEA notification type
to notify guest after recording CPER for guest;

This series patches are based on Qemu 2.12, which have two parts:
1. Generate APEI/GHES table and record CPER for guest in runtime.
2. Handle the SIGBUS signal, record the CPER and fill into guest memory,
   then according to SIGBUS type(BUS_MCEERR_AR or BUS_MCEERR_AO), using
   different ACPI notification type to notify guest.

Whole solution was suggested by James(james.morse@arm.com); APEI part solution is suggested by
Laszlo(lersek@redhat.com). Shown some discussion in [1].


This series patches have already tested on ARM64 platform with RAS feature enabled:
Show the APEI part verification result in [2]
Show the BUS_MCEERR_AR SIGBUS handling verification result in [3]
---
Change since v14:
1. Remove the BUS_MCEERR_AO handling logic because this asynchronous signal was masked by main thread 
2. Address some Igor Mammedov's comments(ACPI part)
   1) change the comments for the enum AcpiHestNotifyType definition and remove ditto in patch 1
   2) change some patch commit messages and separate "APEI GHES table generation" patch to more patches.
3. Address some peter's comments(arm64 Synchronous External Abort injection)
   1) change some code notes
   2) using arm_current_el() for current EL
   2) use the helper functions for those (syn_data_abort_*).

Change since v13:
1. Move the patches that set guest ESR and inject virtual SError out of this series
2. Clean and optimize the APEI part patches 
3. Update the commit messages and add some comments for the code

Change since v12:
1. Address Paolo's comments to move HWPoisonPage definition to accel/kvm/kvm-all.c
2. Only call kvm_cpu_synchronize_state() when get the BUS_MCEERR_AR signal
3. Only add and enable GPIO-Signal and ARMv8 SEA two hardware error sources
4. Address Michael's comments to not sync SPDX from Linux kernel header file 

Change since v11:
Address James's comments(james.morse@arm.com)
1. Check whether KVM has the capability to to set ESR instead of detecting host CPU RAS capability
2. For SIGBUS_MCEERR_AR SIGBUS, use Synchronous-External-Abort(SEA) notification type
   for SIGBUS_MCEERR_AO SIGBUS, use GPIO-Signal notification


Address Shannon's comments(for ACPI part):
1. Unify hest_ghes.c and hest_ghes.h license declaration
2. Remove unnecessary including "qmp-commands.h" in hest_ghes.c
3. Unconditionally add guest APEI table based on James's comments(james.morse@arm.com) 
4. Add a option to virt machine for migration compatibility. On new virt machine it's on
   by default while off for old ones, we enabled it since 2.12
5. Refer to the ACPI spec version which introduces Hardware Error Notification first time
6. Add ACPI_HEST_NOTIFY_RESERVED notification type

Address Igor's comments(for ACPI part):
1. Add doc patch first which will describe how it's supposed to work between QEMU/firmware/guest
   OS with expected flows.
2. Move APEI diagrams into doc/spec patch
3. Remove redundant g_malloc in ghes_record_cper()
4. Use build_append_int_noprefix() API to compose whole error status block and whole APEI table, 
   and try to get rid of most structures in patch 1, as they will be left unused after that
5. Reuse something like https://github.com/imammedo/qemu/commit/3d2fd6d13a3ea298d2ee814835495ce6241d085c
   to build GAS
6. Remove much offsetof() in the function
7. Build independent tables first and only then build dependent tables passing to it pointers
   to previously build table if necessary.
8. Redefine macro GHES_ACPI_HEST_NOTIFY_RESERVED to ACPI_HEST_ERROR_SOURCE_COUNT to avoid confusion


Address Peter Maydell's comments
1. linux-headers is done as a patch of their own created using scripts/update-linux-headers.sh run against a
   mainline kernel tree 
2. Tested whether this patchset builds OK on aarch32  
3. Abstract Hwpoison page adding code  out properly into a cpu-independent source file from target/i386/kvm.c,
   such as kvm-all.c
4. Add doc-comment formatted documentation comment for new globally-visible function prototype in a header

Note: the UEFI(QEMU_EFI.fd) is needed if guest want to use ACPI table.

After guest boot up, dump the APEI table, then can see the initialized table
(1) # iasl -p ./HEST -d /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/HEST
(2) # cat HEST.dsl

(3) After a synchronous external abort(SEA) happen, Qemu receive a SIGBUS and 
    filled the CPER into guest GHES memory.  For example, according to above table,
    the address that contains the physical address of a block of memory that holds
    the error status data for this abort is 0x00000000785D0040
(4) the address for SEA notification error source is 0x785d80b0
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0040
    00000000785d0040: 0x785d80b0

(5) check the content of generic error status block and generic error data entry
    (qemu) xp /100x 0x785d80b0
    00000000785d80b0: 0x00000001 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000098
    00000000785d80c0: 0x00000000 0xa5bc1114 0x4ede6f64 0x833e63b8
    00000000785d80d0: 0xb1837ced 0x00000000 0x00000300 0x00000050
    00000000785d80e0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000
    00000000785d80f0: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000
    00000000785d8100: 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00004002
(6) check the OSPM's ACK value(for example SEA)
    /* Before OSPM acknowledges the error, check the ACK value */
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0098
    00000000785d00f0: 0x00000000

    /* After OSPM acknowledges the error, check the ACK value, it change to 1 from 0 */
    (qemu) xp /1 0x00000000785D0098
    00000000785d00f0: 0x00000001

[3]: KVM deliver "BUS_MCEERR_AR" to Qemu, Qemu record the guest CPER and inject
    synchronous external abort to notify guest, then guest do the recovery.
