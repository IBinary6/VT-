Recent reports of lockdep splats in the HV KVM code revealed that it
was taking the kvm->lock mutex in several contexts where a vcpu mutex
was already held.  Lockdep has only started warning since I added code
to take the vcpu mutexes in the XIVE device release functions, but
since Documentation/virtual/kvm/locking.txt specifies that the vcpu
mutexes nest inside kvm->lock, it seems that the new code is correct
and it is most of the old uses of kvm->lock that are wrong.

This series should fix the problems, by adding new mutexes that nest
inside the vcpu mutexes and using them instead of kvm->lock.

Paul.
