aarch64 vcpu setup requires a vcpu init step that takes a kvm_vcpu_init
struct. So far we've just hard coded that to be one that requests no
features and always uses KVM_ARM_TARGET_GENERIC_V8 for the target. We
should have used the preferred target from the beginning, so we do that
now, and we also provide an API to unit tests to select a target of their
choosing and/or cpu features.

Switching to the preferred target fixes running on platforms that don't
like KVM_ARM_TARGET_GENERIC_V8. The new API will be made use of with
some coming unit tests.
