Subject: [PATCH 0/2] KVM: x86: Don't re-{try,execute} L2 instrs
Date: Wed, 22 Aug 2018 14:52:23 -0700
Message-Id: <20180822215225.28703-1-sean.j.christopherson@intel.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.18.0
Sender: kvm-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <kvm.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: kvm@vger.kernel.org
X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV using ClamSMTP

Fix a bug where L2 can get stuck in an infinite fault loop due to an
L0 MMIO emulation failure that L0 thinks can be fixed by restarting
L2 (it thinks the fault is in the guest's domain because L0 tries
to translate an L2 GPA as an L2 GVA, i.e. CR2 isn't actually a CR2).

Sean Christopherson (2):
  KVM: x86: Do not re-{try,execute} after failed emulation in L2
  KVM: x86: Set EMULTYPE_NO_REEXECUTE for MMIO emulation
