Current mdev device create interface depends on fixed mdev type, which get uuid
from user to create instance of mdev device. If user wants to use customized
number of resource for mdev device, then only can create new mdev type for that
which may not be flexible. This requirement comes not only from to be able to
allocate flexible resources for KVMGT, but also from Intel scalable IO
virtualization which would use vfio/mdev to be able to allocate arbitrary
resources on mdev instance. More info on [1] [2] [3].

To allow to create user defined resources for mdev, it trys to extend mdev
create interface by adding new "aggregate=xxx" parameter following UUID, for
target mdev type if aggregation is supported, it can create new mdev device
which contains resources combined by number of instances, e.g

    echo "<uuid>,aggregate=10" > create

VM manager e.g libvirt can check mdev type with "aggregation" attribute which
can support this setting. If no "aggregation" attribute found for mdev type,
previous behavior is still kept for one instance allocation. And new sysfs
attribute "aggregated_instances" is created for each mdev device to show allocated number.

v2:
  - Add new create_with_instances driver hook
  - Update doc for new attributes

v3:
  - Rename parameter and attribute names from review
  - Make "aggregation" attribute to show maxium resource number
    for aggregation
  - Check driver hooks for attribute create validation
  - Update doc and ABI spec
