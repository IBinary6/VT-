##### From: Vitaly Kuznetsov <vkuznets@redhat.com>

```c

Major changes since RFC:
- With multi-root caching we shouldn't worry about CR3/EPTP changes any
  more, when MMU is split we have two separate caches and these should
  work well.
- Merge 'scache' data with kvm_mmu_page_role to avoid data and code
  duplication.

Currently, when we switch from L1 to L2 (VMX) we do the following:
- Re-initialize L1 MMU as shadow EPT MMU (nested_ept_init_mmu_context())
- Re-initialize 'nested' MMU (nested_vmx_load_cr3() -> init_kvm_nested_mmu())

When we switch back we do:
- Re-initialize L1 MMU (nested_vmx_load_cr3() -> init_kvm_tdp_mmu())

This seems to be sub-optimal. Initializing MMU is expensive (thanks to
update_permission_bitmask(), update_pkru_bitmask(),..) Try solving the
issue by splitting L1-normal and L1-nested MMUs and checking if MMU reset
is really needed. This spares us about 1000 cpu cycles on nested vmexit.

Brief look at SVM makes me think it can be optimized the exact same way.
I'll do this in a separate series if nobody objects.
