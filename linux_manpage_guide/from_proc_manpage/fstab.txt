FSTAB(5)                                        File Formats                                        FSTAB(5)

NAME
       fstab - static information about the filesystems

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/fstab

DESCRIPTION
       The file fstab contains descriptive information about the filesystems the system can mount.  fstab is
       only read by programs, and not written; it is the duty of the system administrator to properly create
       and  maintain  this  file.  The order of records in fstab is important because fsck(8), mount(8), and
       umount(8) sequentially iterate through fstab doing their thing.

       Each filesystem is described on a separate line.  Fields on each line are separated by tabs  or  spa‐
       ces.  Lines starting with '#' are comments.  Blank lines are ignored.

       The following is a typical example of an fstab entry:

              LABEL=t-home2   /home      ext4    defaults,auto_da_alloc      0  2

       The first field (fs_spec).
              This field describes the block special device or remote filesystem to be mounted.

              For  ordinary  mounts,  it  will  hold  (a link to) a block special device node (as created by
              mknod(8)) for the device to be mounted, like `/dev/cdrom' or  `/dev/sdb7'.   For  NFS  mounts,
              this  field  is  <host>:<dir>,  e.g.,  `knuth.aeb.nl:/'.  For filesystems with no storage, any
              string can be used, and will show up in df(1) output, for example.  Typical  usage  is  `proc'
              for  procfs;  `mem',  `none',  or `tmpfs' for tmpfs.  Other special filesystems, like udev and
              sysfs, are typically not listed in fstab.

              LABEL=<label> or UUID=<uuid> may be given instead of a device name.  This is  the  recommended
              method,  as  device  names are often a coincidence of hardware detection order, and can change
              when other disks are added or removed.  For example, `LABEL=Boot' or `UUID=3e6be9de-8139-11d1‐
              -9106-a43f08d823a6'.  (Use a filesystem-specific tool like e2label(8), xfs_admin(8), or fatla‐
              bel(8) to set LABELs on filesystems).

              It's also possible to use PARTUUID= and PARTLABEL=. These partitions identifiers are supported
              for example for GUID Partition Table (GPT).

              See mount(8), blkid(8) or lsblk(8) for more details about device identifiers.

              Note  that  mount(8)  uses  UUIDs  as strings. The string representation of the UUID should be
              based on lower case characters.

       The second field (fs_file).
              This field describes the mount point (target) for the filesystem.  For swap  partitions,  this
              field  should  be  specified as `none'. If the name of the mount point contains spaces or tabs
              these can be escaped as `\040' and '\011' respectively.

       The third field (fs_vfstype).
              This field describes the type of the filesystem.  Linux supports many filesystem types:  ext4,
              xfs,  btrfs, f2fs, vfat, ntfs, hfsplus, tmpfs, sysfs, proc, iso9660, udf, squashfs, nfs, cifs,
              and many more.  For more details, see mount(8).

              An entry swap denotes a file or partition to be used for swapping, cf.  swapon(8).   An  entry
              none is useful for bind or move mounts.

              More than one type may be specified in a comma-separated list.

              mount(8) and umount(8) support filesystem subtypes.  The subtype is defined by '.subtype' suf‐
              fix.  For example 'fuse.sshfs'. It's recommended to use subtype notation rather than  add  any
              prefix to the first fstab field (for example 'sshfs#example.com' is deprecated).

       The fourth field (fs_mntops).
              This field describes the mount options associated with the filesystem.

              It  is formatted as a comma-separated list of options.  It contains at least the type of mount
              (ro or rw), plus any additional options appropriate to the filesystem type (including  perfor‐
              mance-tuning options).  For details, see mount(8) or swapon(8).

              Basic filesystem-independent options are:

              defaults
                     use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.

              noauto do not mount when "mount -a" is given (e.g., at boot time)

              user   allow a user to mount

              owner  allow device owner to mount

              comment
                     or x-<name> for use by fstab-maintaining programs

              nofail do not report errors for this device if it does not exist.

       The fifth field (fs_freq).
              This  field  is used by dump(8) to determine which filesystems need to be dumped.  Defaults to
              zero (don't dump) if not present.

       The sixth field (fs_passno).
              This field is used by fsck(8) to determine the order in which filesystem checks  are  done  at
              boot  time.  The root filesystem should be specified with a fs_passno of 1.  Other filesystems
              should have a fs_passno of 2.  Filesystems within a drive will be  checked  sequentially,  but
              filesystems on different drives will be checked at the same time to utilize parallelism avail‐
              able in the hardware.  Defaults to zero (don't fsck) if not present.

NOTES
       The proper way to read records from fstab is to use the routines getmntent(3) or libmount.

       The keyword ignore as a filesystem type (3rd field) is no longer supported by the pure libmount based
       mount utility (since util-linux v2.22).
